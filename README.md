# Welcome to my LL Blog Project!

Just to clarify, LL stands for Lucas Lopes!

This project wal part of the Try course I'm taking in Brasil.

This API was created using tool as Node.js and MySQL with Sequelize.

In this project, the folders of sequelize were given by trybe, adding the config.js file and the seeders, just for the tests of the course work fine!

All the Routes, Services, Models, Controllers, Middlewares and Utils were developed by me.

Thanks for seeing my Project!
